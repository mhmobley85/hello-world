Hi!

My name is Mark Mobley. I started my software development career in 1985 in Atlanta, GA as a software engineer at Samna Corporation. I began writing printer drivers for the Samna Word word processor. This was around the time the first Hewlett Packard LaserJet printer was introduced. Dot matrix and daisy wheel impact printers were the most common printers at the time.
